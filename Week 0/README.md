## Week 0 -- Install Required Software

Before we begin our class, we would like everyone to have Python 3 installed on their laptops so that they can follow along in class. We will be using Miniconda, which includes Python 3, along with an easy system for installing Python packages.

[Installing Miniconda on Mac](Installing miniconda on Mac.md)

We will also need a text editor to create and edit Python script files. We will be using Sublime Text 2 as the text editor that we will be demonstrating with in class.
